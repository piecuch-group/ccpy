# CCpy: A coupled-cluster package written in Python.

## Overview
<p align="justify">
CCpy is a research-level Python package for performing non-relativistic electronic structure calculations for molecular systems 
using methods based on the ground-state coupled-cluster (CC) theory and its equation-of-motion (EOM) extension
to electronic excited, attached, and ionized states. As a design philosophy, CCpy favors simplicity over efficiency, and this is reflected in the
usage of computational routines that are transparent enough so that they can be easily used, modified, and extended, while 
still maintaining reasonable efficiency. To this end, CCpy employs a hybrid Python-Fortran programming approach made possible
with the f2py package, which allows one to compile Fortran code into shared object libraries containing subroutines
that are callable from Python and interoperable with Numpy arrays. 

*Important Note: The compliation of Fortran modules with ```f2py``` is not currently compatible with Python 3.12 due to
the migration away from ```numpy.distutils```. In order to fix this, we are moving over to compilation using
```meson```. In the meantime, please use Python 3.11 when building CCpy.*

## Available Computational Options
<p align="justify">
CCpy specializes in applying the CC(P;Q) and externally corrected (ec) CC methodologies developed in the Piecuch group at 
Michigan State University. In CC(P;Q), the energetics obtained by solving the ground- or excited-state CC/EOMCC equations in
one subspace of the many-electron Hilbert space, called the P space, are corrected for the missing many-electron correlation
effects captured with the help of a complementary subspace called the Q space using the state-selective, non-iterative,
and non-perturbative energy corrections based on the CC moment expansion formalism. Currently, CCpy offers implementations
of several CC(P;Q) methods, the majority of which are aimed at converging the high-level CCSDT and EOMCCSDT energetics. 
These include the completely-renormalized (CR) methods such as the CR-CC(2,3) and CR-CC(2,4) triples and quadruples 
corrections to CCSD, the active-space CCSDt and CC(t;3) approaches, which are based on a user-defined selection of active orbitals, 
and the black-box selected configuration interaction (CI) driven and adaptive CC(P;Q) methodologies, which construct the P and Q spaces 
entering the CC(P;Q) computations using information extracted from selected CI wave functions or the adaptive CC(P;Q) moment 
expansions themselves, respectively. The ec-CC approaches on the other hand seek to converge the exact, full CI energetics
directly by solving for the T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> clusters in the presence of the leading T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> clusters extracted from an
external non-CC wave function. Current implementations of the ec-CC approaches in CCpy are designed to iterate T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> clusters 
in the presence of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> obtained from CI wave functions of the selected CI or multireference CI types, and correct the resulting
energetics for the missing many-electron correlations using the generalized moment expansions of the ec-CC equations.

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The CC with doubles (CCD) method truncates the cluster operator as T = T<sub>2</sub>.
It has iterative computational costs that scale as 
n<sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>n<sub>u</sub><sup>4</sup>, where n<sub>o</sub> is 
the number of correlated occupied orbitals and n<sub>u</sub> is the number of 
correlated unoccupied orbitals. 
Due to the importance of pair correlations in the many-electron problem, the
CCD approximation was first introduced in Prof. Čížek's landmark 1966 paper
under the name coupled-pair many-electron theory, or CPMET. Although CCD is
often superceeded by the more accurate CC with singles and doubles (CCSD) method,
which has the same computational scaling, CCD is still relevant to modern CC
calculations within the context of correlating orbital-optimized reference
functions, as in Brückner CCD.

<summary>CCSD(T)</summary>

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The CCSD(T) method corrects the CCSD energy for the correlation effects
due to T<sub>3</sub> clusters using formulas derived using many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT). In particular, the CCSD(T) correction includes the leading 
4th-order energy correction for T<sub>3</sub> along with 5th-order contribution
due to disconnected triples. The inclusion
of the latter term distinguishes CCSD(T) from its CCSD[T] precedessor.
CCSD(T) has noniterative computational costs that

the number of correlated occupied orbitals and n<sub>u</sub> is the number of

<summary>CR-CC(2,3)</summary>

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The CR-CC(2,3) approach is a nonperturbative and noniterative correction to the
CCSD energetics that accounts for the correlation effects due to T<sub>3</sub>
clusters using formulas derived from the biorthogonal moment energy expansions of CC
theory. In particular, CR-CC(2,3) represents the most robust scheme to noniteratively
include the effects of connected triples on top of CCSD, and it is capable of providing an 
accurate description of closed-shell molecules in addition to commonly encountered
multireference problems, such as single bond breaking and open-shell radical 
and diradical species, which are generally beyond the scope of perturbative 
methods like CCSD(T). The CR-CC(2,3) triples correction uses noniterative steps
that scale as n<sub>o</sub><sup>3</sup>n<sub>4</sub><sup>4</sup>, where n<sub>o</sub> is 
the number of correlated occupied orbitals and n<sub>u</sub> is the number of 
correlated unoccupied orbitals, however, due to the precise form of the 
expressions defining the CR-CC(2,3) triples correction, it is approximately
twice as expensive as its CCSD(T) counterpart. One must also solve the companion 
left-CCSD system of linear equations (roughly as expensive as CCSD) prior
to computing the CR-CC(2,3) correction.

The CR-CC(2,3) calculation returns four distinct energetics, labelled as 
CR-CC(2,3)<sub>X</sub>, for X = A, B, C, and D, where each variant A-D corresponds to 
a different treatment of the energy denominators entering the formula for 
the CR-CC(2,3) triples correction. The variant CR-CC(2,3)<sub>A</sub> uses the simplest 
Møller-Plesset form of the energy denominator and is equivalent to the method 
called CCSD(2)<sub>T</sub>. Meanwhile, the CR-CC(2,3)<sub>D</sub> result, which employs 
the full Epstein-Nesbet energy denominator, is generally most accurate and often 
reported as the CR-CC(2,3) energy (or by its former name, CR-CCSD(T)<sub>L</sub>).

```
The latter CC(*P*)-based approach offers two advantages: (i) it can take advantage of
the Abelian point group symmetry of a molecule by restricting the CC calculation to
include only those triply excited cluster amplitudes belonging to a particular irrep,
as specified by the keyword `target_irrep` and (ii) it can be used to perform other
types of active-orbital-based CCSDt calculations based on restricting `num_active` 
occupied/unoccupied indices to the active set. The standard choice of 
`num_active=1` results in the usual CCSDt method, however `num_active=2` and 
`num_active=3` result in the CCSDt(II) and CCSDt(III) approaches introduced in Ref. [X].

As in the case of the CCSDt calculations, the general CC(*P*) approach allows one
to perform alternative active-orbital-based truncation schemes of the CCSDt(II) 
and CCSDt(III) types in addition to the standard CCSDt method. The corresponding
CC(*P*;*Q*) corrections result in the CC(t;3)(II), CC(t;3)(III), and CC(t;3) 
approaches, respectively.

Because CCpy is primarily used for CC method development work, we use interfaces to GAMESS and PySCF to obtain the mean-field (typically Hartree-Fock)
reference state and associated one- and two-electron integrals in the molecular orbital basis prior to performing the correlated CC calculations. All implementations
in CCpy are based on the spin-integrated spinorbital formulation and are compatible with RHF and ROHF references.
