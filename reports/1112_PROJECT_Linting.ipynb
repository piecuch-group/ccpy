However, in many cases, the variable names made sense in the context of the application (e.g., labelling quantities and many-body diagrams consistent with what they would look like when derived using literature notation), hence I did not think it was a good idea to change most of the variable names. As a result, I had low lint scores, but I was able to fix most of the other errors related to whitespace errors and import statements in my code."
